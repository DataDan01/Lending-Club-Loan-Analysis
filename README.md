# Lending Club Loan Analysis

This repo contains R Markdown Notebooks that highlight my analysis of the [Lending Club Loan Data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). Lending Club releases information on all loans made through its platform over various time periods. This analysis focuses on public data from the first quarter of 2017. It is split up into two parts: exploratory analysis and predictive analysis.

These notebooks are meant to be run interactively, chunk by chunk. Here's a more [detailed guide](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) on how to get the most out of this format.
